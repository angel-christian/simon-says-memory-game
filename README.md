# 🎮 Simon Says – Memory Game

A classic "Simon Says" memory game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Test your memory as you repeat an ever-growing sequence of flashing buttons — how far can you go?

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Random color sequence generation each round
- 🧠 Tracks your input and checks against the correct pattern
- 💥 "Game Over" screen with your current score and highest score (saved locally)
- 🎧 Sound effects for success and failure
- 🖥️👆 Works on both **desktop** (keyboard start) and **mobile** (start button)
- 💡 Responsive design using media queries

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**
   - On PC: Press any key
   - On Mobile: Tap the **Start** button

2. **Watch carefully** as one button flashes.

3. **Repeat the pattern** by clicking the buttons in the same order.

4. The sequence gets longer each level. Try to keep up!

5. Game ends when you click a wrong button — your highest score is saved.
